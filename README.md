# Jetpack Compose Quadrant App

This Android app is a small learning project built using Jetpack Compose as part of the Google Developers Android learning program.
The goal of this project was to understand modern UI development in Android using industry-standard tools and practices.

# 📱 Overview

The app displays a four-quadrant layout, where each quadrant highlights a different Jetpack Compose concept such as:

Text Composables

Image Composables

Row Layouts

Column Layouts

# Each section includes a short description, helping reinforce how these core building blocks work in Compose.

# This project focuses on:
✔ Declarative UI design
✔ Layout composition
✔ Reusable composable functions
✔ Clean and structured code

# 🛠 Tech & Tools
